## About
Pastecard is the digital equivalent on the back of your hand. It's available wherever you have an Internet connection, including your phone. The advantage is you can just erase it when you don't need it anymore, instead of washing your hand or throwing away another sticky note.

## Usage
Once Pastecard is loaded in your browser, click or tap the card to make it editable. You can then save your changes or cancel the edit. Try out [a demo card](http://pastecard.net/demo/) (edits are lost on refresh) or [view the help page](http://pastecard.net/help/).

Running an instance of Pastecard on your own server is as easy as downloading this Github repository as a .zip, and then uploading the whole directory as-is to your server. Just navigate to the directory in a browser to start using Pastecard.
