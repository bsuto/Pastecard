# Pastecard

Pastecard is the digital equivalent of the back of your hand. It's accessible without a login wherever you have an Internet connection, including your phone. The advantage is you can just erase it when you don't need it anymore, instead of washing your hand or throwing away another sticky note.

There's a [sample card](https://pastecard.net/demo/) (edits are lost on refresh) and a fuller [help page](https://pastecard.net/help/) for more information.

## About this repository

This is the equivalent of the Pastecard web app for a single user, from the 2018â€“2024 era. You should be able to upload this directory as-is to your host, as long as it has PHP 5 and an SSL certificate. **Note:** improvements and other changes to the Pastecard web app from 2025 onward will not necessarily be reflected here.
