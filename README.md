## About
Pastecard is the digital equivalent on the back of your hand. It's available wherever you have an Internet connection, including your phone. The advantage is you can just erase it when you don't need it anymore, instead of washing your hand or throwing away another sticky note.

To use, download this repository as a .zip and then upload the whole directory as-is to your host. Open it in your browser, click or tap the card to make it editable, and save the changes (or cancel). There's a [demo card](http://pastecard.net/demo/) (edits are lost on refresh) and a fuller [help page](http://pastecard.net/help/) for more information. Enjoy!
