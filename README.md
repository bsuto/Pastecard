# Pastecard

Pastecard is the digital equivalent of the back of your hand. It's accessible without a login wherever you have an Internet connection, including your phone. The advantage is you can just erase it when you don't need it anymore, instead of washing your hand or throwing away another sticky note.

There's a [sample card](https://pastecard.net/demo/) (edits are lost on refresh) and a fuller [help page](https://pastecard.net/help/) for more information.

Sign up for a hosted account at [pastecard.net](https://pastecard.net) or upload this repository as-is to your own hosting provider (SSL required).
